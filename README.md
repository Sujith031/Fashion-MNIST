### Fashion-MNIST

Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article imagesâ€”consisting of a training set of *60,000* examples and a test set of *10,000* examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. It's intended that Fashion-MNIST to serve as a direct drop-in replacement for the original MNIST dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms.

This project aims to build a machine learning model on Fashion-MNIST using Apache Spark for data processing, Apache Airflow for pipeline orchestration, MLflow for experiment tracking, and a REST API for model serving. The project also includes Prometheus for metrics instrumentation and Grafana for visualization.
